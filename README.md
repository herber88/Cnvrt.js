ConvertJS
=========

Library for easily converting between units and currencies.

Example:

    var tempInFahrenheit = Cnvrt.Celsius(20).to(Cnvrt.Fahrenheit);
    tempInFahrenheit.toString(); //Outputs 68Â°F

Unit tested and the current feature set should be fairly stable. But you'll probably have to add your own units.
